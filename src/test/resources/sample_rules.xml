        Entity is a way to group rules based on data sources
        For all purposes now, we can consider data sources to be urls
        Wildcards are supported.
        * - matches all.
        flipkart.com/* - matches all urls that start with flipkart.com/<anything>
        flipkart.com/ - matches only one url which is "flipkart.com/"

        This rule definition schema was defined with information region extraction and attribute extraction in mind
        It does not seem to natively lend itself to other systems that may need rule based processing.
